Here is the OCR of the first page of the PDF, including the context, text, and image descriptions.

- Context: This page introduces the concept of an explainable coding assistant and its strategic analysis and positioning. It highlights the importance of trust in AI coding assistants and discusses the market landscape, focusing on throughput and transparency.

- Text: Al Coding Assistants: Strategic Analysis + Positioning for an
Explainable Coding Assistant
Strategic focus: "Al Coding Assistant that Explains Itself" - calibrated confidence + reasoning to build developer trust.
Author context: UC Berkeley MEng (IEOR), transitioning from GE Vernova into AI PM roles.
Market context: ~$3B+ by 2028 (directional).
1) Problem Statement: Trust is the Bottleneck
Al coding assistants are getting integrated into daily workflows, but real adoption plateaus on a
simple question: “Should I accept this suggestion?" Today's tools optimize for throughput
(autocomplete, multi-file edits, agents), but developers pay a “trust tax”: time spent verifying
outputs, undoing unintended changes, and constraining agents.
The trust breakdown is most visible when tools act autonomously inside a repo. Developers
frequently describe avoiding agentic behavior because they can't confidently bound impact:
"Having it write anything itself in my code base isn't something I trust.”

"DO NOT tell it to commit. Do not give it access to commit anything."

Failures are not only "wrong answers.” They're often confidently wrong behavior under partial
context:
"Lack of context... mixed with a 'trying to do what you asked' hallucination.”

"Hallucinated so much... it... re-write the whole code multiple times... effectively just deleting
the whole app and starting again."

Synthesized pain points (from research notes) match the above: context window limits in large
codebases, hallucinated code that "looks right,” inconsistent code style, lack of explanation for why
a suggestion is best, and fear of over-reliance/skill degradation. The biggest gap is therefore not
capability; it's calibrated trust.
2) Market Landscape: Strong Throughput, Weak Transparency
The landscape clusters into (a) IDE-native copilots, (b) Al-native IDEs, and (c) agentic workflow
tools. Distribution winners and UX winners still face the same adoption ceiling: users can't easily
see uncertainty or reason about impact radius.
Power users compensate by "forcing” context:
"I never really knew if my instruction files were being used... I tagged them in my prompt... to
'force' the file to be used in context."
